### Ohufi! 🌴

I'm a software engineering student from Ohio, US. 💻

I primarily write HTML/CSS, sometimes Python; but I'm learning Javascript, C#, and further languages. 🌐

I'm a [Stitch fursuiter](https://twitter.com/sillystitchy), and I use He/Him/They/Them. 👾

I happen to quite like [@dfault-user](https://github.com/dfault-user) 💙
